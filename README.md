# CitySprout: a step towards urban farming
A project which was made for a hackathon based on problem statement related to agriculture. We extended a solution with respected to urban farming by automating the process of controlling urban crop growing process. An IOT cloud was used to interface user with working of all the sensors and motors used in this project.

This project prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Arduino IDE.
- Working of ESP32 dev module (pin outs).
- Basics of coding.
- Basics of working of electronic circuits and sensors like PIR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture sensor, pH sensor, water level sensor, DHT22 sensor.
