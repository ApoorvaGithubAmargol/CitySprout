# CitySprout: a step towards urban farming
A project which was made for a hackathon based on problem statement related to agriculture. We extended a solution with respected to urban farming by automating the process of controlling urban crop growing process. An IOT cloud was used to interface user with working of all the sensors and motors used in this project.

This project prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Arduino IDE.
- Working of ESP32 dev module (pin outs).
- Basics of coding.
- Basics of working of electronic circuits and sensors like PIR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture sensor, pH sensor, water level sensor, DHT22 sensor.

Here's what we implemented:

🦉 Predator Deterrence: Ultrasonic sensors paired with buzzers to keep pests away.

💧 Water Management: Soil moisture sensors to automate irrigation by switching the motor on/off as needed.

🍃 Nutrient Monitoring: Notifications on the interface to alert users about nutrient requirements.

🌊 Water Level Detection: Ensuring optimal water supply for plants.

All these features were linked to the Blynk app, providing real-time updates and controls to users.

# Interface with Blynk IOT:

--> **Steps to use Blynk IOT**

- Create a blynk cloud account to get started with.
- Create a new project and start editing your template according to your requirements. Remember all the virtual pins used in blynk cloud, and mention the same in your main code.
